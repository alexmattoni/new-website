# This is RPI Ambulance's new website.

The main goal is to port the [old website](https://github.com/rpiambulance/website) to Angular.

Once we have achieved a similar style, we will then work on modernizing features and migrating the database to something a little more extensible.

# Development Environment Setup

This is probably not right or fully complete.

1. Download latest Node.js
2. Clone repository.
3. Run 'npm install'
4. Run 'docker compose up --build'
5. Hopefully it is working.
