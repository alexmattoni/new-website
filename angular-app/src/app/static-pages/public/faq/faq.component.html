	        <p class="">RPI Ambulance is a student-run volunteer organization/ agency certified by NY state to provide emergency medical service to our area. This alone says one important thing — with only a few exceptions, we are all students, and of course we understand classes and homework are the #1 priority of our members.</p>

	    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
	        <p class="">No! You just need to attend our new member orientation and go through our HIPAA and OSHA classes. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions.</p>

	        <h2>What prior experience do I need?</h2>
	    </div>
	    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
	        <p class="">Absolutely nothing. We do not require any training to join, but highly encourage training once a member. If you already have a non-New York EMT certification, talk to one of our officers about getting reciprocity in NY state.</p>

	        <h2>What training is provided to me and what positions can I achieve?</h2>
	    </div>
	    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
	        <p class="">We provide training for almost all of our levels at no cost to you. You will begin at RPIA as an Observer. Observers have no training and do exactly what you think they would do, observe. The next level up is Attendant. An attendant is trained in CPR and has gone through a short class to understand the basic layout of the ambulance, how to use the equipment, as well as how to perform basic assessment skills. They assist the crew and work under the direct supervision of the crew chief. The other two positions available are Driver and Crew Chief. Drivers go through our Driver Training program. Before they can officially become a driver they must be an attendant and pass a promotional board. Crew Chiefs are the highest position within the agency and hold the most responsibility. They must be New York State EMTs and go through our Crew Chief Class. Classes are typically held once a year, but if the demand is present, they can be done more frequently.</p>

	        <p class="">This header is asked frequently at the student activity fair — which is great! The more certified people, the better! There is usually an EMT class held every semester. These classes are not taught by RPI Ambulance; they are taught by certified EMT Instructors. Please contact one of the officers for more information.</p>

	    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
	        <p class="">Great! We can get you information on who to contact to apply for reciprocity and have your certification carry over to New York State. For information, please contact one of the officers and see the NYS DOH EMS Reciprocity page.</p>

	        <h2>Do I get paid?</h2>
	    </div>
	    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
	        <p class="">Sorry, no. We are all volunteers and work for no monetary compensation. But if you are working with RPI Ambulance at a hockey game, football game or the Houston Field House concert you will probably get to see some or all of the show for free.</p>
